** About dedop_run_scheduler
The dedop_run_scheduler script in intended to work with [[https://github.com/DeDop/dedop-core][dedop-core]].

What can do dedop_run_scheduler:

 - Run one dedop job per input ncfile and several jobs in parallel.

 - Automate the scheduling of parallel dedop jobs up to a limit
   defined by the user OR computed from the number of logical CPUs of
   the running machine.  Run a new job each time another one
   terminates, until no more files are to be processed.

 - By default, run on the default user's workspace input files, using
   the default workspace's configuration.

 - Optionally ignore the processing if output file(s) already
   existing, honouring =dedop run= '-s' option.

 - Automatically kill dedop jobs that have been running for too long
   (workaround an infinte loop bug in dedop-core versions <=1.1.0).

So far, only [[https://github.com/DeDop/dedop-core/releases/download/v1.3.0/DeDop-core-1.3.0-Linux-x86_64.sh%0A][bundled package of dedop-core v1.3.0]] has been tested, but
it should work with all versions.

The script is mature enough to be run for production purposes.
